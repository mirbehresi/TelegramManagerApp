## 🌐 Proxy Setup Guide

TelegramManager supports using SOCKS5 proxies to keep your accounts safe and reduce the risk of bans.

### 🔄 How it works

When you launch the application, it looks for a file named `proxy.txt` in the **application root directory**.  
If found, it will automatically import all proxies listed in that file into the app’s internal database.

### 🧾 proxy.txt format

Each line in the file must follow this format:

```

host\:port\:username\:password

```

For example:

```

127.0.0.1:1080\:user1\:pass1
192.168.1.10:1080\:proxyuser\:proxypass
45.144.255.10:1080\:hello123\:world456

```

✅ Supported:
- Only **SOCKS5 proxies** with authentication
- Each line must have 4 parts separated by `:` (host, port, username, password)

❌ Not supported:
- HTTP proxies
- Proxies without username/password

### 📂 Where to put the file

Place your `proxy.txt` file directly in the same folder as the executable file (`TelegramManager.exe`).  
The file will be automatically **imported on startup** and **deleted** afterward for security.

> 🔐 Tip: Don’t forget to add fresh proxies regularly for maximum protection!
